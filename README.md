# Kaggle Traffic Sign Recognition Competition
This repository consists the code for the Kaggle German Traffic Sign classification competition, which is organized by the graduate computer vision course I took. 

There're three python files in the python files folder. 

In STN_model.py, I defined a model which consists of two STN blocks and three CNN blocks to do the image classification task.

In train_functions.py, I defined the functions for training and evaluation, as well as a class for the creating the dataset.

In main.py, I did the task of preparing the training data, train teh model, and create the submission file for the Kaggle competition. 

I finally managed to be in top 10% in this Kaggle compitition whose participants are mainly graduate students of NYU.
